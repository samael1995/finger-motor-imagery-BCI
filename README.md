# finger motor imagery BCI

In this project we tried to identify finger motor imagery from EEG signals and train a machine learning model for this purpose. 

we used dataset which was published in the follwoing article:

Kaya, M., Binli, M., Ozbay, E. et al. A large electroencephalographic motor imagery dataset for electroencephalographic brain computer interfaces. Sci Data 5, 180211 (2018).
https://doi.org/10.1038/sdata.2018.211


the only data with frequency sample of  200 Hz were uploaded. for accessing to the whole dataset use the following link:
